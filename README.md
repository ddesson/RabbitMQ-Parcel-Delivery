# RabbitMQ-Parcel-Delivery

This is a  RabbitMQ Example Project that creates a Parcel Delivery Broker.
i was working on some tutorials on RabbitMQ and I decided to create my own Project as a learning tool. Initially this Project will use C# but I plan to use other languages such as Python and Java. 

This Project is an application to determine the best way to send a Parcel. You can send a parcel to anouther City or within the same city.

The user will decide if the delivery is to Maximize speed or to Minimize cost.

Since thia Application is a Broker, there will be several Parcel Delivery Companies that will compete, based on delivery time and cost for the delivery of the Parcel between the specified cities. The weight of the Parcel will also be taken inconsideration when calculating cost.
